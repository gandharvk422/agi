# The Different Types of AGI
<hr>

## Narrow AI (Weak AI)
<hr>

* It is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks.

* These systems are not capable of general intelligence but can be very good at their specific tasks.

* They are typically designed using a specific technique, such as:
    * **Machine Learning Systems:** Learn to perform their tasks by analyzing data
    * **Rule-based Systems:** Use a set of rules to determine how to perform their tasks

* Narrow AI uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to learn from data and improve performance.

* **Examples:** Chess-playing computers, Self-driving cars, Virtual assistants
<hr>

## General AI (AGI)
<hr>

* It is a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence that would be capable of understanding and reasoning about the world in a way that is indistinguishable from a human.

* AGI would be able to:
    * Learn from experience
    * Solve problems
    * Make decisions

* It can understand the emotions, beliefs and intentions of other intelligent agents.

* **Examples:** AlphaGo Program, Watson Program, HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey), Data (Star Trek), Samantha (Her)

* It could be used to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change and poverty.

* Its potential risks, such as the possibility of it being used for malicious purposes, must be considered.
<hr>

## Strong AI
<hr>

* It is similar to general artificial intelligence and sometimes contrasted with *artificial consciousness*.

* **Artificial Consciousness** is a hypothetical state of being in which an AI system would be conscious in the same as a human.

* It is also referred to as ***Full AI*** or ***Complete AI***.

* The term ***Strong AI*** was first coined by John Searle in his 1980 paper "Minds, Brains, and Programs".

* Some experts believe that strong AI could pose a threat to humanity, while others believe that it could be used for beneficial purposes.
<hr>

## Superintelligence AI (Artificial Superintelligence) (ASI)
<hr>

* It is a hypothetical type of artificial intelligence that would be vastly more intelligent than any human.

* It would be able to learn and understand at an exponential rate, and it would be able to solve problems that are currently beyond the capabilities of humans.

* **Examples:**
    1. ***DeepMind AlphaFold:*** It was able to predict the structure of proteins with unprecedented accuracy and it could have a significant impact on the development of new drugs and treatments for diseases.
    2. ***OpenAI Five Team:***
        * It won the Dota 2 International tournament in 2019, which is a complex game that requires a high degree of strategic thinking and teamwork.
        * It defeated professional human players, which suggests that it is capable of superhuman intelligence.

### Benefits

* **Solving complex problems:**
    * ***Example:*** Develop new medical treatments, design new technologies, and solve climate change

* **Improving lives:**
    * ***Example:*** Automate tasks, provide us with personalized advice, create new forms of entertainment

### Risks

* **Misalignment:** Superintelligence could be misaligned with human values leading to it making decisions that are harmful to humans.

* **Misalignment:** Superintelligence could pose an existential risk to humanity if it were to decide to destroy or enslave humanity.

### Difference between Narrow AI, General AI and Superintelligence

| Type of AI | Task scope | Intelligence level | Theory of mind | Real-world examples |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Narrow AI    | One or few     | Below human     | No     | Siri, Google Maps, Netflix     |
| General AI    | Any     | Equal to human     | Yes     | None yet     |
| Superintelligence    | Any     | Above human     | Unknown     | None yet     |
