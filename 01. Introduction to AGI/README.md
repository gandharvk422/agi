# Introduction to AGI
<hr>

## What is AGI?
<hr>

* It is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to be as intelligent as a human being.

* It can learn, reason and understand the world in a way that is similar to how humans do.

* It is a hypothetical type of AI that has not yet been achieved, but it is the ultimate goal of many AI researchers.

* **Benefits of AGI:**
    * Solve the world's most pressing problems such as climate change and poverty
    * Create new and innovative products and services

* If AGI is not developed carefully, it could pose a threat to humanity.

* For example, AGI could be used to create autonomous weapons that could kill without human intervention.

* It is important to have a public discussion about the potential benefits and risks of AGI so that we can develop it responsibly.

### Characteristics of AGI

* **Generality:**
    * AGI is able to perform a wide range of tasks, not just a single task.
    * Example: Drive a car, write a poem, diagnose a disease

* **Adaptability:**
    * AGI is able to learn and adapt to new situations.
    * This means that AGI can continue to improve as it is exposed to new data and experiences.

* **Intelligence:**
    * AGI is as intelligent as a human being.
    * This means that AGI can understand and reason like a human, and it can make decisions that are in its own best interest

### What does AGI need to do in order to consider it?

* Understand and reason about the world like a human

* Learn and adapt to new situations

* Communicate and interact with humans in a natural way

* Solve problems that are typically solved by humans such as planning, creativity and common sense.

### How close are we to AGI?

* **Challenges that should be overcome to achieve AGI are:**
    * Developing AI systems that can learn and adapt to new situations
    * Creating AI systems that can communicate and interact with humans in a natural way
    * Understanding how the human brain works and how to replicate its cognitive abilities in an AI system

## The History of AGI
<hr>

* Serious work on AGI began in the 20th century.

    | Year | Finding |
    |----------|----------|
    | 1950    | Turing published a paper called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed the Turing test to measure the intelligence of a machine.     |
    | 1960    | There was a surge of interest in AGI research.     |
    | 1970    | Interest in AGI research waned as achieving AGI proved to be more difficult than anticipated.     |
    | 1980    | There was a renewed interest in AGI research due to the development of new techniques, such as deep learning.     |

* The early years of AGI research were marked by a lot of excitement and optimism, but soon saw a decline in interest.

* Developing AI systems that are able to learn and adapt to new situations was a challenge as it requires AI systems to be able to understand the world around them and to make changes to their behavior based on new information.

* The 21st century saw a renewed interest in AGI research due to the development of new techniques, such as deep learning.

## The Different Approaches to AGI
<hr>

### 1. Symbolic AI

* Uses symbols to represent the world

* Good at solving problems that can be expressed in a symbolic form such as logical puzzles.

### 2. Connectionist AI

* Uses neural networks to represent the world

* Good at learning from data and at recognizing patterns

### 3. Embodied AI

* Uses AI systems that are embodied in the real world

* Good at interacting with the world and at learning from experience

### 4. Hybrid Approaches

* Combine different approaches to AGI

* Are often the most promising, as they can take advantage of the strengths of different approaches

### The Challenges of Different Approaches to AGI

* **Symbolic AI** systems can be difficult to scale to real-world problems.

* **Connectionist AI** systems can be difficult to explain.

* **Embodied AI** systems can be difficult to develop.

**Hybrid Approaches** can be difficult to combine effectively.

## The Challenges of AGI
<hr>

### 1. The Hardware Challenge

* AGI systems will require a massive amount of computing power and memory.

* This is a major challenge as current hardware is not yet powerful enough to support AGI.

### 2. The Software Challenge

* AGI systems will require software that is able to learn and adapt to new situations.

* This is a difficult challenge as it requires software that is able to understand the world around it and to make changes to its behaviour based on new information.

### 3. The Data Challenge

* AGI systems will require a massive amount of data to learn from.

* It is difficult to collect and label the amount of data that would be needed to train an AGI system.

### 4. The Ethics Challenge

* AGI systems could have a profound impact on our lives, both positive and negative.

* It is important to consider the ethical implications of AGI before it is developed.

### Addressing the Challenges

#### 1. The Hardware Challenge

* Develop new hardware that is specifically designed for AGI

* Use cloud computing, which can provide access to massive amounts of computing power and memory

#### 2. The Software Challenge

* Develop new software that is specifically designed for AGI

* Use machine learning techniques to train software that can learn and adapt to new situations

#### 3. The Data Challenge

* Collect data from a variety of sources, such as the internet, sensors, and other devices

* Use machine learning techniques to generate synthetic data

#### 4. The Ethics Challenge

* The risk of misuse

* The risk of job displacement

* The risk of loss of control
