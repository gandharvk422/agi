# The Different Levels of AGI
<hr>

## Level 1: AGI can perform a single task well
<hr>

* It is a first level of AGI and can perform a single task well but cannot generalize another tasks.

* **Example:** A level 1 AGI system that can play Chess well will not be able to play Go well.

* It is sometimes referred to as *task-specific AGI* or *narrow AGI*.

* **Example of Level 1 AGI System:**
    1. ***Siri:***
        * Makes phone calls, sends messages, sets reminders, plays music
        * Uses NLP, speech recognition, and ML to process voice commands and provide relevant responses
        * It cannot learn from its own experience or adapt to new situations that it has not encountered before
    2. ***Google's DeepMind AlphaFold:***
        * Predict the 3-dimensional structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequences.
        * Cannot perform any other task than protein folding, or apply its learning to any other domain
        * Cannot understand the meaning or purpose of protein folding, or the implications of its predictions for biology and medicine

### The Future of Level 1 AGI

* Level 1 AGI could be used to automate tasks, improve decision-making, and create new forms of entertainment.
<hr>

## Level 2: AGI can perform multiple tasks well
<hr>

* It is the second level of artificial general intelligence that can perform multiple tasks well, but they are still limited in their ability to generalize to new tasks.

* **Example:** A level 2 AGI system that can play Chess and Go well, will not be able to play a new game well, such as Poker.

* It must be able to learn from the experiences and apply its learnings to new situations.

* It must be able to understand the consequences of their actions and choose the best course of action.

* It is sometimes reffered to as *Multi-task AGI* or *General-purpose AGI*.

* **Example of Level 2 AGI System:**
    1. ***IBM's Watson Supercomputer:***
        * It can perform tasks such as:
            * Answering questions
            * Diagnosing diseases
            * Analyzing data
            * Playing chess
        * To process information and provide answers, it can use:
            * Natural Language Processing (NLP)
            * Knowledge reasoning
            * Machine learning
        * It cannot perform tasks that are outside its domain of expertise.
        * It cannot learn from its own experience or adapt to new situations that it has not encountered before.
    2. ***Google's DeepMind AlphaGo:***
        * It can play the board game Go at a superhuman level.
        * It can use deep neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn from millions of games and improve its strategies.
        * It cannot play any other game than Go or apply its learning to any other domain.
        * It cannot understand the meaning or purpose of the game or the emotions or intentions of its opponents.

### The Future of Level 2 AGI

* In this level, AGI systems can perform more than one task that requires human intelligence, such as:
    * Speech recognition
    * Facial recognition
    * Self-driving cars

* Tasks may be related or unrelated, but they are specific and predefined.

* They can use machine learning and deep learning techniques to learn from data and improve their performance.

* Cannot handle tasks that they have not been trained or programmed for

* Cannot transfer their knowledge or skills from one task to another

* **Risks:**
    * It could be used to create autonomous weapons that could kill without human intervention.
    * It could be used to create deepfakes that could be used to spread misinformation or propaganda.
<hr>

## Level 3: AGI can learn and adapt to new situations
<hr>

* They can perform multiple tasks well, learn from their own experience, and adapt to new situations they have not encountered before.

* Can handle uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity in a flexible and robust way.

* Can transfer their knowledge and skills from one domain to another, and generalize learning across different contexts

* It is sometimes referred to as *Strong AI* or *Artificial Superintelligence*.

* **Example of Level 3 AGI System:**
    * Can play a game without being explicitly programmed or trained for it
    * Can learn the rules and strategies of any game by observing or playing it and then apply them to new games or scenarios
    * Can adjust its behavior based on the feedback and actions of other players

* It would be able to perform tasks that require:
    * Creativity
    * Intuition
    * Common sense

* It would also be able to understand natural language and communicate with humans in a natural and coherent way.

### Limitations

* It might not be able to understand the emotions, beliefs, and intentions of other intelligent agents.

* It might lack self-awareness and consciousness, which are essential aspects of human intelligence.
<hr>

## Level 4: AGI can understand and reason like a human
<hr>

* They can understand and reason like a human.

* This means they can understand:
    * Meaning of language
    * Relationships between concepts
    * Implications of their actions

* **Example of Level 4 AGI System:**
    * This system would be one that can pass the **Turing** test.
    * **Turing** test is a test that evaluates if a machine's behavior can be distinguished from a human's.
    * In this test, a human evaluator interacts with a machine and a human through text messages and tries to guess which one is which.
    * If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the difference between the machine and the human, the machine passes the test.

* This system would be able to communicate with humans in a natural and coherent way, using:
    * Humor
    * Sarcasm
    * Emotion
    * Personality

* It would also be able to understand the emotions, beliefs, and intentions of other intelligent agents.

* **Example of Level 4 AGI System:**
    * This system would be one that can solve complex problems that require reasoning and planning, such as playing Chess or Go at a superhuman level.
    * It would be able to use advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to model human cognition and behavior
    * Learn from its own experience and improve its strategies over time
    * Explain its moves and justify its choices

* It is sometimes referred to as *Superhuman AI* or *Ultra-intelligent AI*.

### Limitations

* It might not have self-awareness and consciousness, essential aspects of human intelligence.

* It might lack moral values and ethical principles, important for social interactions and decision-making.

## Level 5: AGI is indistinguishable from a human

* These are indistinguishable from humans in terms of their intelligence, capabilities, and behavior.

* Can understand and reason like humans and also have self-awareness and consciousness.

* Can reflect on their own existence and identity

* Can have moral values and ethical principles that guide their actions and decisions

* **Example of Level 5 AGI System:**
    * This system would be one that can pass the **Mirror** test.
    * **Mirror** test is a test that evaluates if an animal or a machine can recognize itself in a mirror.
    * In this test, a mark is placed on the subject's body without its knowledge and then exposed to a mirror.
    * If the subject touches or investigates the mark on its own body after seeing it in the mirror, it passes the test.
    * It would be able to express its feelings and preferences, as well as empathize with others.

* **Example of Level 5 AGI System:**
    * This system would be one that can pass the **Chinese Room** test.
    * **Chinese Room** test is a test that evaluates if a machine can understand natural language rather than just manipulate symbols.
    * In this test, a person who does not speak Chinese is locked in a room with a set of rules for manipulating Chinese symbols.
    * The person receives questions in Chinese and uses the rules to produce answers without understanding their meaning.
    * If the answers are indistinguishable from those of a native Chinese speaker, the person passes the test.

* It would be indistinguishable from a human and would surpass human intelligence in many aspects.

* It would have the potential to create new forms of intelligence and technology that are beyond human comprehension.

* The risk of loss of control
